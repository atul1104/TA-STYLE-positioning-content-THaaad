                    <p class="text">In our urban and suburban houses what should we do without cats? In our sitting or bedrooms, our libraries, in our kitchen or storerooms,our farms, barns, and rickyards, in our docks our granaries, our ships, and our wharves, in our corn markets, meat markets and other places too numerous to mention, ow useful they are! In our ships, however, rats offset them at defiance; still they are of great service.</p>
                    <p class="text">How wonderfully patient is the cat when watching for rats or moce, awaiting their egress from their place of refuge or that which is their hom! How well Shakespeare in Pericles, Act III., describe this keen attention of the cat to its natural pursuit!</p>
                    <p class="text">The cat, with eyne of burning coal, Now crouches from(before) the mouse's hole.</p>
                    <p class="text">A slight rustle, and the fugitive comes forth; a quick, sharp, resolute motion, and the cat has proved its usefulness. Let any one have a plauge of rats and mice, as I once had, let them be delivered therefrom by cats, as I was, and they will have a lasting and kind regard for them.</p>
